# Physics Simulations with Python

These are visual simulations of thermal, orbital, and fluid physics algorithms and representations using a combination of NumPy, Matplotlib and Pygame.

Orbital Simulation

In pygame, an accurate simulation of planets in our solar sytem orbiting the Sun, listed is the bodies distance from the sun. Presented with pygame.
